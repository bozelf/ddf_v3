      <p class="text-md mb-6">At Data & Depth & Flow, we believe bioinformatics should be thoughtful, creative, and collaborative. We offer a space where learning is hands-on, consulting is personal, and data analysis becomes a meaningful process rather than a mechanical task. With roots in science, care, and curiosity ‚Äî this is a place where your research can breathe.<br><br>Are you forgetting to enjoy the process because of deadlines and stress? Let's bring a sense of wonder and fun back into your science.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">üë©‚Äçüíª Who am I?</h2>
  <p class="text-md mb-4">
    I hold a PhD in population genetics and a master‚Äôs degree in bioinformatics.<br>
    Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on ancient DNA, large-scale sequencing data, and genetic variation in a wide range of species.
    I‚Äôve spent a significant part of my academic and professional life exploring how we can understand life‚Äôs complexity through biological data.
  </p>
  <p class="text-md mb-4">
    But along the way, I noticed something missing: <strong>joy</strong>.
    The pressure to perform, publish, and deliver often overshadows the curiosity and creativity that brought many of us into science in the first place.
    I found myself craving a different way of working ‚Äî one that values reflection, collaboration, and a deeper sense of purpose.
  </p>
  <p class="text-md mb-4">
    So I‚Äôm taking a step forward.
    I‚Äôm building a space ‚Äî and eventually, a team ‚Äî that approaches bioinformatics with clarity, flexibility, and human connection.
    It‚Äôs about making space for thoughtful research, for learning that‚Äôs actually engaging, and for data analysis that feels empowering rather than overwhelming.
  </p>
  <p class="text-md">
    It‚Äôs a challenging path.<br>
    But I believe it‚Äôs worth it.<br>
    And if this resonates with you, perhaps you're in the right place too.
